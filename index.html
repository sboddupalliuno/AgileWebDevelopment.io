            Agile web Development is a wide-ranging category of methodologies that are based on the principles designed in the Manifesto for
            Agile Software Development, which was listed by the professional developers in 2001. Scrum and XP are also measured as agile though they
            had lasted before the manifesto was written. Manifesto encouraged a new thought process to software development with a good start
            for developers and designers to use different kinds of tasks.

        <p>
            There are a lot of different concepts behind the agile development that look insightful to developers; however, agile was uncompromising of doing the things.
            Agile web development is mixed to the traditional method, but still, agile remains to be popular in the software world.

            <h3>Understanding Traditional Web Development V/S Agile Web Development</h3>

        <p>
            Traditional software development is based on a different stage of the software development lifecycle. The flow of the traditional is uniform
            from planning to analysis, then to design, then to testing and maintenance. This approach is said to the Waterfall approach, where the process
            cannot bypass the phases, whereas Agile is precise and customer friendly. The user has the opportunity to perform changes throughout the
            project development phases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Agile uses an adaptive approach where there is no detailed planning, and there is clarity on future tasks. The product is tested very frequently through the release iterations, minimizing the risk of
            any major failures in the future. Predictive methods entirely depend on the requirement analysis and planning done at the beginning of the
            cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Customer Interaction is a strong pillar for the Agile method, and it has a feature of open communication with minimum documentation.
            Documentation believes to be a high priority and becomes expensive and very time consuming to create in the Waterfall approach.
        </p>

        <h3>Advantages of Agile Web Development</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Keeping up with changes:</li>
            <p>
                The agile is flexible. The agile system gives flexibility to developers to make the changes as per the client requirement.
                It provides a very realistic approach to software development.
            </p>
            <br>

            <li>Costs:</li>
            <p>
                Easy to manage because of the flexibility and efficient development where it discards the need for the overtime payment.
            </p>
            <br>

            <li> Customer Satisfaction:</li>
            <p>
                The application passes through many check processes before releasing the product, which gives the customer bug-free product making
                the customer more satisfactory and happy.
            </p>
            <br>

            <li>Little or no planning required:</li>
            <p>
                There are minimal rules, and documentation can be easily employed as there is no need for one specific document need to be maintained
                for overall process or need to be updated every time, and resource requirements are also minimum
            </p>
            <br>

            <li>Transparency:</li>
            <p>
                Agile reduces the risk, or we can a risk-free process because it provides open communication between the client and the project lead.
                It is excellent for those who value transparency.
