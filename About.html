            <p> Hello Everyone Iâ€™m Shweta Boddupalli </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I have completed my undergraduate education in Financial Management from India.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I have worked as a Part of offsite migration of UK management companies accounts as a Senior Financial Analyst for the last
                5.5 years. I have done many projects by visiting the onsite place (London, UK), getting trained from the Licensed Skill Manager
                about the changes in CASS Rollout (Client Asset) as per UK Financial Regulation Act, and provide the same Training at the Offsite.
                Before providing Training, we need to go through the process of Reviewing the Procedure, Collecting Client Data, Restructuring Data,
                Meeting Client Requirement, Analysis, and Testing the tools. Being a non-programmer, I used to put on my consistent efforts to deliver
                the application successfully without any incidents, for which I used to learn and implement new tools & technologies on the fly if
                required.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Something interesting about me is that I love to travel and explore different places, gardening and baking.
